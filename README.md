> Reset Button: Resets the score whenever you want.

=> Technologies Used:

I've added a new "Auto Play" feature to my Rock Paper Scissors game! 🎮 

🔹 Clicking the "Auto Play" button makes the game automatically choose a move from the player's side at random. 

🔹 The button text updates to "Stop Auto Play" while it's running.

🔹 Clicking it again stops the autoplay, giving full control back to the player. 

This feature makes the game more dynamic and fun to watch! Let me know what you think. 🚀
